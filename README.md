# Chess_Engine_Improved

An improvement to an old Chess Engine I originally made in Java ([the old engine](https://github.com/GoldenRare/Chess_Engine)). The old engine used a 2D Array and made
generating moves very time consuming since it didn't have access to a precalculated table of where each piece can attack, in addition to other time consuming functions. 
Essentially, the old chess engine could on average only calculate 4 depths in a reasonable amount of time. This new chess engine uses more modern approaches found in 
current chess engines, primarily [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish), which is what this project is heavily based on. The goal of this project was a 
learning experience to simply understand as to how modern chess engines play as strong as they do.
